Process Profile

    Definition: An occurrent that is part of a process, representing the rate, pattern, or amplitude of change in an attribute of one or more participants during that process.

Speed

    Definition: A Process Profile representing the rate at which an object covers distance over time during a process.

Flight Speed

    Definition: A Speed that represents the rate at which an aircraft moves through the air during the Flight process.

Velocity

    Definition: A Process Profile representing the rate and direction of an object's motion during a process.

Angular Velocity

    Definition: A Velocity representing the rate of change of an object's angular position during a process.

N1 Speed

    Definition: An Angular Velocity representing the rotational speed of the engine's low-pressure spool during the Engine Operation process.

Dimensionless Quantity

    Definition: A Process Profile that is a pure number without units, derived from the ratio of two quantities with the same dimensions.

Mach Number

    Definition: A Dimensionless Quantity representing the ratio of an aircraft's speed to the speed of sound during the Flight process.


Dimensionless Process Profile

    Definition: A process profile that represents a dimensionless quantity characterizing a process through the ratio of two like-dimensional attributes of the process participants.
        Genus: Process Profile
        Differentia: representing a dimensionless quantity derived from the ratio of two like-dimensional attributes within a process.

Mach Number

    Definition: A dimensionless process profile representing the ratio of the aircraft's speed to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium during flight.
        Genus: Dimensionless Process Profile
        Differentia: representing the ratio of flight speed to the speed of sound.

Allows for the inclusion of other dimensionless quantities relevant to process characterization.
