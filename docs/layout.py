Key Modeling Decisions

    Representing the Airfoil and Its Regions:
        The airfoil itself is a Material Artifact (a type of object in BFO terms). We can introduce a subclass Airfoil under Material Artifact.
        The leading edge, trailing edge, tip, and platform can be modeled as Fiat Object Parts of the airfoil. For example:
            AirfoilRegion (subclass of fiat object part)
                AirfoilEdge
                    LeadingEdge
                    TrailingEdge
                AirfoilTip
                AirfoilPlatform

    These regions are fiat boundaries, i.e., they do not correspond to a physically separated component but a region on the airfoil.

    Representing a Defect:
    A defect can be considered as a Specifically Dependent Continuant inhering in the airfoil (or specifically in a region of the airfoil). Since a defect is not just a quality like color, but rather a sort of damage state or local feature, we have two possible approaches:

        Treat the defect as a type of Quality (BFO:0000019) that inheres in the airfoil. We might create a subclass Defect under Quality.

        Alternatively, treat it as a kind of “Damaged Stasis” (under Stasis of Specifically Dependent Continuant) if you want to model it as a state or condition of damage. But since we have direct measurements (distances, depths, lengths), modeling as a Quality with associated measurements is simpler.

    For simplicity, let's define:
        AirfoilDefect as a subclass of Quality.

    Each recorded defect will be an instance of AirfoilDefect that inheres in a particular airfoil and region.

    Distances and Measurements:
    The rules define indices as shortest and longest distances from specific datum references. Distances, depths, and lengths are best represented as Measurement Information Content Entities linked to Information Bearing Entities holding literal numeric values and associated units.

    For example, Dmg. Edge Closest to Datum (Index 1) can be modeled as a Distance Measurement Information Content Entity inhering in the defect. The actual numeric values (e.g., 0.16) will be associated via an Information Bearing Entity and a has_decimal_value or has_float_value property.

    We also need to capture the datum references (tip or platform). The datum (tip, platform) can be represented as part of the Airfoil structure (as a Fiat Object Part) against which distances are measured.

    Inspection Method:
    The “scanbox” inspection is a process (an Act of Measuring) or a method. We can represent the inspection process as an instance of Act of Measuring or InspectionMethod (a subclass of Directive Information Content Entity or as a planned process).

    For simplicity:
        ScanboxInspection as an instance of Act of Measuring.

    Each defect record is detected_by or generated_by this scanning process:
        defect detected_by scanboxInspection.

    Datum Interpretation (Tip vs. Platform):
    The given rule states:
        If defect is on an edge:
            Index 1 = shortest distance from tip to defect or longest distance from platform to defect
            Index 2 = longest distance from tip to defect or shortest distance from platform to defect
            Index 3 = longest distance from edge actual to defect

    Since all provided data are on the leading edge with the datum being tip, we can simplify:
        Index 1: shortest distance from tip (the given datum) to defect.
        Index 2: longest distance from tip to defect (or consider platform relations if needed, but here the datum=tip suggests these two measurements are from the tip).
        Index 3: defect depth (which can be considered a Thickness or Depth).
        Index 4: defect length (a Length).

    Each index corresponds to a measurement. For example:
        Create data properties or object properties to link defect → measurement:
            has_closest_distance_from_datum (connects to a Distance Measurement Information Content Entity)
            has_furthest_distance_from_datum (also a Distance Measurement Information Content Entity)
            has_defect_depth (a Depth measurement)
            has_defect_length (a Length measurement)

    Alternatively, these can be represented as distinct measurement individuals linked from the defect.

    Data Properties and Individuals:
    For each row in the info table, create:
        An individual Airfoil_X for the given airfoil number.
        A Defect_X individual for each defect (row).
        Link Defect_X to Airfoil_X via inheres_in.
        Specify that Defect_X is located at a LeadingEdge region of Airfoil_X.
        Attach measurement entities for distances and depths.

    Example for row 1:
        Airfoil #1: :Airfoil_1 a :Airfoil .
        Defect #1: :Defect_1 a :AirfoilDefect ; cco:inheres_in :Airfoil_1 ; :located_in :LeadingEdgeOfAirfoil_1 ; :detected_by :ScanboxInspection .

    Then represent the measurements:
        Dmg. Edge Closest to Datum = 0.16
        Dmg. Edge Furthest to Datum = 0.408
        Dmg. Depth = 0.092
        Dmg. Length = 0.249

    For each measurement:

    :Defect_1_closestDist a cco:DistanceMeasurementInformationContentEntity ;
        cco:generically_depends_on :Defect_1_closestDist_IBE ;
        cco:is_about :Defect_1 .

    :Defect_1_closestDist_IBE a cco:InformationBearingEntity ;
        cco:has_decimal_value "0.16"^^xsd:float ;
        cco:uses_measurement_unit :Meter .  # or appropriate unit

    :Defect_1 has_closest_distance_from_datum :Defect_1_closestDist .

    Repeat similarly for the other indices (furthest distance, depth, length).

Incorporating the Rule Template

Given the rules:

    On edge defects (which we have):
        Index 1 = shortest distance from tip to defect or longest distance from platform to defect
        Index 2 = longest distance from tip to defect or shortest distance from platform to defect
        Index 3 = longest distance from edge actual to defect
        Index 4 = damage length

In the provided data, datum is tip, so Index 1 and Index 2 are distances from the tip. We can specify:

    Index 1 = :has_closest_distance_from_tip
    Index 2 = :has_furthest_distance_from_tip
    Index 3 = :has_defect_depth
    Index 4 = :has_defect_length

Each of these would be a Ratio Measurement Information Content Entity (distance, depth, length are ratio scales) linked to a unit (likely meters or millimeters).
Class Placement Suggestions

    Airfoil:
    Airfoil rdfs:subClassOf :Material Artifact

    AirfoilRegion:
    AirfoilRegion rdfs:subClassOf bfo:fiat_object_part

    LeadingEdge:
    LeadingEdge rdfs:subClassOf :AirfoilRegion

    AirfoilDefect: AirfoilDefect rdfs:subClassOf quality
    (Alternatively, AirfoilDefect could be a type of Damaged Stasis if you want to indicate a damage condition rather than a stable quality.)

    InspectionMethod (Scanbox): You could create a class InspectionProcess (subclass of Act of Measuring) and an instance :ScanboxInspection a :InspectionProcess.

    Measurement Entities:
    Use existing Measurement Information Content Entity classes from CCO. For distances, use Ratio Measurement Information Content Entity plus has_integer_value, has_decimal_value, and link to appropriate Measurement Unit of Length.

Summary

    Airfoil: material artifact
    Edges and tips: fiat object parts of airfoil
    Defect: a type of quality (or damaged stasis) inhering in the airfoil
    Measurements (Indices): ratio measurement information content entities linked to information bearing entities with numeric values and units
    Inspection Method: process instances indicating how defect data was obtained

This approach fits into the provided ontology hierarchy and uses existing concepts from BFO and CCO. It allows capturing the rule-based interpretation of each index and the data from the info table to populate the knowledge graph.
