1. Analyzed Decision Support Questions (DSQs)

    Workshop Studies:
        Collected and reviewed DSQs from workshops.
    Refinement:
        Narrowed down questions to focus on common themes and concepts.
    Gap Analysis:
        Identified and studied gaps in existing ontology coverage.

2. Studied Standards and Frameworks

    International Standards:
        ISO Standards: Utilized to define concepts and differentiate terms.
        Aerospace Recommended Practices (ARP): Incorporated for fault/failure analysis and safety assessments.
    Established Ontologies:
        Common Core Ontology (CCO): Leveraged for mid-level domain interoperability.
        Relations Ontology (RO): Adopted standardized relationships for consistent reasoning.
        Industrial Ontologies Foundry Core (IOF Core): Applied for industrial-grade ontology integration.

3. Ontology Development and Modeling

    Class Development:
        Created and defined new classes aligned with the REO standard.
    Axiom Creation:
        Developed axioms to establish logical relationships and constraints.
    Object and Value Properties:
        Designed object properties and value properties to define scopes and relationships.

4. Integration and Refinement

    Existing Ontology Integration:
        Seamlessly integrated new components with the existing REO ontology without disrupting current structures.
    IRI Refinement:
        Ensured that Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) are precise and well-refined for consistency.

5. Documentation and Validation

    Comprehensive Documentation:
        Created detailed documentation and comparison documents to support ontology use and maintenance.
    Data Extraction and Refinement:
        Compiled detailed Excel spreadsheets extracting elements of the ontology, including definitions, axioms, usage, and examples.
    File Refinement:
        Developed refined versions of Turtle (.ttl) files for improved clarity and functionality.
    Testing and Validation:
        Tested ontology imports on the KW Graph Platform to verify validity and correctness of code.
