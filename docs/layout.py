3. Flight Data

Definition: Flight Data is a collection of engine operational parameter measurements and other relevant measurements recorded during a flight.

  2. Engine Operation

You asked whether Engine Operation can be an Act of Artifact Employment. Let's examine this.
Option 1: Mechanical Process

Definition: Engine Operation is a mechanical process involving the functioning of an engine to produce mechanical power or thrust.


4. Engine Operation
Engine Operation (Process)

Definition: Engine Operation is a mechanical process wherein an engine performs its function of converting fuel into mechanical power or thrust.



Benign Operation

Definition: Benign Operation is an engine operation characterized by lower thrust settings, reduced flight speeds, and lower thrust utilization, resulting in less stress on engine components.

5. Benign and Severe Operation

These are classifications of Engine Operation based on the values of the operational parameters.
Benign Operation

Definition: Benign Operation is an engine operation characterized by operational parameters within ranges that cause minimal stress on the engine components.

Severe Operation

Definition: Severe Operation is an engine operation characterized by high thrust settings, high ambient temperatures, and prolonged use of maximum thrust, leading to increased stress on engine components.


  Severe Operation

Definition: Severe Operation is an engine operation characterized by operational parameters within ranges that cause increased stress on the engine components.


  

Engine Operational Parameter (Quality)

Definition: An Engine Operational Parameter is a quality that inheres in an engine operation process, representing a measurable physical property such as speed, altitude, or Mach number.

Mach Number (Quality)

Definition: Mach Number is an engine operational parameter quality representing the ratio of the aircraft's flight speed to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium.



Mission Type is a subclass of Classification that categorizes Missions according to characteristics like duration, flight profile, and operational parameters.

Mission: A Mission is a planned act undertaken to achieve specific objectives, involving one or more processes or activities orchestrated to fulfill a particular purpose.

Aircraft Mission: A Mission where an Aircraft undertakes a flight to fulfill specific operational objectives, such as passenger transport, cargo delivery, or military operation.

Engine Mission: A Mission involving the operation of an Engine to fulfill specific objectives, such as testing, maintenance, or performance evaluation.

Dimensionless Quantity -
  
Dimensionless Quantity: A physical quality that is a pure number without any physical units, resulting from the ratio of two quantities of the same dimension.

Mach Number: A dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of the speed of an object (e.g., an aircraft) to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium.





  

Dimensionless Quantity: A process profile that is a pure number without physical units, resulting from the ratio of two quantities of the same dimension.

Mach Number: A dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of an aircraft's flight speed to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium.





Use "N1 Speed" as the class name in the ontology.
Include "Low-Pressure Spool Speed" as an alternative label or synonym for clarity.

Definition:

    N1 Speed: A Rotational Speed representing the rotational velocity of a jet engine's low-pressure spool, expressed as a percentage of its maximum rated speed or in revolutions per minute (RPM).
